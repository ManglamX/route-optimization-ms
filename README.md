Problem statement:
ackstory: 
The tiffin service, a cornerstone of daily meals for millions in urban India, is a
 business model built on efficiency and trust. However, most local providers
 operate on thin margins and face immense logistical hurdles. Their reliance on
 manual processes for planning delivery routes results in wasted time, excessive
 fuel consumption, and frequent delays. In an age of on-demand services, these
 traditional businesses lack the technology to provide modern conveniences like
 live tracking and flexible subscription management, putting them at a
 competitive disadvantage.
 Problem Statement: 
 Develop 'NourishNet,' a comprehensive Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform
 designed to digitize and optimize the operations of local tiffin services. The
 solution must serve as a dual-sided platform: a powerful B2B management
 dashboard for vendors to streamline their logistics and business processes,
 and a modern B2C mobile app for consumers to manage their subscriptions
 and track their daily meals.
 Key Features:
 Vendor Operations Dashboard: A web-based admin panel for tiffin providers
 to manage their entire subscriber base, create and publish dynamic
 daily/weekly menus, view sales analytics, and manage their delivery staff.
 AI-Powered Route Optimization: The platform's core engine ingests all of the
 day's delivery addresses and utilizes a route-planning algorithm (e.g., a
 solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem) to calculate and display the
 most efficient multi-stop route on a map for the delivery person.
 Real-Time Delivery Tracking (Consumer App): A user-facing mobile app that
 provides customers with a live map view of the delivery person's location, an
 accurate estimated time of arrival (ETA), and push notifications for key
 delivery milestones.
 Flexible Subscription & Billing Management: A robust system to handle
 complex subscription logic, including daily, weekly, and monthly plans,
 pause/resume functionality, automated billing cycles with payment gateway
 integration, and customizations for customer meal preferences.
 


# NourishNet Route Optimization Microservice

## Overview
This microservice optimizes delivery routes for the NourishNet SaaS platform, handling daily address inputs to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) or Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). It provides RESTful APIs usable by the React.js vendor dashboard and React Native consumer app. Real-time delivery tracking is enabled via Socket.IO WebSockets, and MongoDB persists data. The service is ready for scalable deployment on AWS.

---

## Key Features

- AI-powered route optimization using Google OR-Tools
- Geocoding via Google Maps or Mapbox APIs for address-to-coordinate conversion
- REST API endpoints for route creation, retrieval, and tracking updates
- Real-time delivery tracking with Socket.IO WebSocket support
- MongoDB integration for data persistence and state management
- Container-ready for seamless AWS deployment (EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda/API Gateway, ECS)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nourishnet/route-optimization-ms.git
cd route-optimization-ms


### 2. Install dependencies
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file with your API keys and MongoDB URI:
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyApcNl1QEvG7TSFexLsYpdyU2G4cEWOfSY
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://ManglamX:Manglam@529@nourishnet.bjjeltx.mongodb.net/NourishNet


### 4. Running the service locally
python app.py
Or, for production

## API Endpoints

| HTTP Method | Endpoint          | Description                              |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| POST        | `/optimize-route` | Accepts a list of addresses and returns an optimized route and ETA |
| GET         | `/route/<id>`     | Retrieves detailed route information by route ID |
| POST        | `/track/update`   | Receives delivery agent GPS location updates for real-time tracking |

All endpoints accept and return JSON payloads.

---

## Integration Guidelines

### a. React.js Vendor Dashboard

- Use `fetch` or `axios` to call the microservice REST APIs.
- Visualize optimized routes using Google Maps JavaScript API or Mapbox GL.
- Connect with the Socket.IO server using the `socket.io-client` library for real-time delivery positions and ETA updates.

### b. React Native Consumer Mobile App

- Fetch route and ETA data from the service using REST API.
- Render maps and delivery routes using `react-native-maps`.
- Subscribe to live location updates and notifications by connecting the app to the Socket.IO WebSocket server with `socket.io-client`.

---

## Real-Time Tracking (Socket.IO)

- The delivery agent’s device pushes GPS updates to the Socket.IO server.
- Connected clients (dashboard, consumer app) receive push notifications and update maps in real time.

Example React/React Native Socket.IO listener:
import io from 'socket.io-client';
const socket = io('https://your-deployment-url');

socket.on('location-update', (data) => {
// Update delivery location on UI map
});


---

## Deployment on AWS

### Recommended process:

1. **Dockerize the microservice:**
docker build -t nourishnet-route-ms .

2. **Deploy:**

- **EC2:** Run the container on an EC2 instance.
- **Elastic Beanstalk:** Deploy via AWS Console or CLI using the Python platform.
- **Lambda + API Gateway:** Use frameworks like Zappa or Serverless Framework for serverless deployment.
- **ECS/EKS:** Push container images to AWS ECR, then deploy using Fargate or Kubernetes.

3. **Configure security:**

- Set up VPCs, security groups, and SSL certificates with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
- Secure environment variables using AWS Secrets Manager.

4. **Update frontend endpoints:**  
Ensure React.js and React Native apps point to your deployed microservice URL.

## Example API Request for route optimization
POST /optimize-route
{
"addresses": [
"123 Marine Drive, Mumbai",
"45 Linking Road, Mumbai",
"67 Brigade Road, Mumbai"
],
"start_location": "Central Kitchen, Mumbai"
}


---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **CORS errors:** Enable CORS middleware on Flask/FastAPI app.
- **Socket.IO disconnects:** Ensure client-server versions match and networking/firewall rules are correct.
- **Database connection issues:** Verify MongoDB URI, network access, and credentials.
- **Deployment errors:** Check AWS security group, environment variables, and logs.
